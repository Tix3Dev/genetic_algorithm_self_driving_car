Things that I need to check:
(indented = checked)

    - car.py: does dna parameter in __init__ work?

- game.py: does normalization work?
- game.py: is the mating_pool correctly filled?
- game.py: does the remove and append of parent1 work?
- game.py: does the new car actually get created/changed?
- game.py: did I forget something in the fr_cnt = fr_lif scope?

- dna.py: is crossover_with overall working?
    -> do the genes actually get changed from both parents?
- dna.py: does the probability work?
- dna.py: does gen actually get changed?
